        <h1><u>ABOUT MY SELF</u></h1>
        <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.<br> Sometimes it is hard to introduce myself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.<br>
             Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description.<br> I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
        <br>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.<br> I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.<br> I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.<br> I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.<br> I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.<br> I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. <br>And, I like to laugh.</p>
